## About ORBITA
ORBITA is a high school flagship project exploring orbital mechanics and battery-powered rocket propulsion. The goal is to research how rockets impact the environment and design simulations to improve efficiency. The project includes Python simulations, trajectory calculations, and detailed documentation.


## Features & Goals
- Simulations of rocket trajectories and orbits  
- Battery propulsion experimentation and calculations  
- Environmental impact assessment of rocket launches  
- Documentation of processes, results, and learnings  


## Skills Developed
- Physics & orbital mechanics  
- Electrical engineering basics (battery propulsion concepts)  
- Python programming for simulations  
- Data analysis and visualization  
- Project documentation and version control  


## How to Use / Run Simulations
*Simulations coming soon. This section will guide users on running ORBITA simulations once available.*
