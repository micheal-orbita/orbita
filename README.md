## About ORBITA-HGX
ORBITA-HGX is a high school flagship project exploring **hybrid rocket propulsion and glide-assisted atmospheric flight**. The project investigates how combining **controlled chemical thrust** with **aerodynamic lift** can reduce fuel consumption, minimize environmental impact, and improve vehicle reusability. The focus is on **simulating trajectories, glide phases, and propulsion optimization**.


## Objectives
- Simulate vertical motion under gravity
- Add chemical propulsion to study acceleration and altitude gain
- Introduce aerodynamic forces (drag and lift) for controlled flight
- Plot trajectories and analyze motion
- Build foundational Python and physics skills
  

## Skills Developed
- Physics & orbital mechanics (trajectories, forces, motion equations)  
- Python programming for simulations and plotting  
- Aerodynamics & lift-to-drag analysis  
- Data analysis and visualization  
- Project documentation and GitHub version control


## Long-Term Goals
- Implement simple simulations combining thrust, drag, and lift
- Document each simulation on GitHub
- Develop a progressive understanding of physics and aerospace principles
- Showcase a fully functioning, physics-based hybrid rocket simulation
  

## How to Start / Use (Coming Soon)
*Simulations are under development. This section will provide instructions on how to run Python scripts and explore ORBITA-HGX trajectories.*
