## About ORBITA-HGX
ORBITA-HGX is a high school flagship project exploring **hybrid rocket propulsion and glide-assisted atmospheric flight**. The project investigates how combining **controlled chemical thrust** with **aerodynamic lift** can reduce fuel consumption, minimize environmental impact, and improve vehicle reusability. The focus is on **simulating trajectories, glide phases, and propulsion optimization**.


## Features & Goals
- Compare **pure rocket trajectories** vs **hybrid rocket + glide trajectories**  
- Analyze **fuel efficiency and flight time**  
- Explore **aerodynamic lift-to-drag ratios** for glide-assisted flight  
- Document all findings, calculations, and Python simulations  


## Skills Developed
- Physics & orbital mechanics (trajectories, forces, motion equations)  
- Python programming for simulations and plotting  
- Aerodynamics & lift-to-drag analysis  
- Data analysis and visualization  
- Project documentation and GitHub version control
  

## How to Start / Use (Coming Soon)
*Simulations are under development. This section will provide instructions on how to run Python scripts and explore ORBITA-HGX trajectories.*
